Chelsea are facing a race against time to find a replacement for goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois , who seems intent
on forcing through a move to Real Madrid . The Belgium international failed to report back to Chelsea
training on Monday as scheduled, where head coach Maurizio Sarri was expecting
to hold face-to-face talks with Courtois about his future. Over the weekend Courtois' agent revealed that his client wants to
move to Madrid to be closer to his family. Courtois has one year left on his contract at Stamford Bridge and
is valued by Real at £32m, but Sky Sports
News understands that Chelsea will not resume talks with the European
champions until they find a suitable replacement.</p><p id="main">REAL WANT ALONSO
