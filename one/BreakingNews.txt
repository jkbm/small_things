BREAKING NEWS
Sky sources understand Chelsea have made Stoke goalkeeper Jack Butland their top target if Thibaut Coutois leaves the club.The Blues have switched their attention to the Stoke
goalkeeper after Everton refused to negotiate over Jordan Pickford and Sky Sports News has been told there has already been informal contact between
Chelsea and Stoke City at boardroom level. It is understood the Potters would be prepared
to allow Butland to leave for around £30m - but want any deal for the England
goalkeeper to be resolved quickly, so that they would have time to buy a
replacement. The closer the negotiations go to 5pm on Thursday, the
more likely it is that Stoke will demand a bigger fee, Sky Sports News
understands.
